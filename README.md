### 5.1. Install Operating System in Head Node
---
Initially, an attempt was made to determine which operating system the ASUS CS-B motherboard supports. However, the information available suggests that the ASUS CS-B is only compatible with Ubuntu 13.10, as indicated in the provided image.

![Os](https://github.com/TeachingMaterial/ace-2023_-team-0/assets/85470428/3f1fbdae-3522-4e26-841c-ef19f4888d5a)
Figure: OS Compatibility of Asus CS-B 

1. Once the operating system was determined, below steps are followed to install ubuntu desktop 13.10:
      - Downloaded the Ubuntu Desktop from the official Ubuntu website (https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/13.10/). As Intel processor is used, PC (Intel x86) desktop image is chosen when downloading the image.
      - Created a bootable USB drive using Rufus.
      - Booted the motherboard from the USB drive.
      - Followed the installation wizard to install Ubuntu Desktop on the system.

2. After the installation process, the system undergoes a series of commands to ensure it possesses the latest security patches and software updates:

                  sudo apt update                                           
            
                  sudo apt upgrade

3. Given its role as the head node in our setup, the desktop image is transformed into a server. Let's quickly delve into the significance of the head node within the realm of High-Performance Computing (HPC).

- The head node serves as a central control unit in an HPC environment, orchestrating and managing the entire cluster. Its primary purposes include task scheduling, resource allocation, and overall coordination of computational tasks within the cluster. By installing      the Ubuntu Server and setting the default target to multi-user mode optimize resource allocation, conserving RAM and CPU resources by eschewing unnecessary graphical sessions. This ensures that the head node operates efficiently, enabling it to efficiently manage and    oversee the computational workload of the entire HPC cluster.
  
            To install Ubuntu Server  : sudo apt install ubuntu-server
            To disable GUI            : sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
     
Although the documentation states that the ASUS CS-B motherboard can only run Ubuntu 13.10, a brief test was run to see how the motherboard would react to installing Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish), a more recent version of the operating system. The Ubuntu 22.04       
operating system ran on the system very well, with no noticeable glitches. This surprising finding prompted more investigation into the motherboard's compatibility with the latest Ubuntu versions. 
Although documentation indicates otherwise, one plausible explanation for Ubuntu 22.04's successful running on the ASUS CS-B motherboard could be the hardware compatibility enhancements included in later Ubuntu editions. The Ubuntu operating system is continuously       improved and optimised by its developers throughout time to improve compatibility with a wider variety of hardware setups. Because of this, more recent versions of Ubuntu might by nature support a greater range of motherboards, including the ASUS CS-B. Moreover,         improvements in system libraries, kernel updates, and device drivers in Ubuntu 22.04 can also be responsible for its smooth operation on the ASUS CS-B motherboard. These updates might take care of any compatibility problems that earlier motherboard models might have     had, making it possible to use current Ubuntu editions more smoothly.
After noticing that Ubuntu 22.04 operated steadily on the ASUS CS-B motherboard, the group chose to switch from Ubuntu 13.10 to this more recent version. This choice was driven by the goal of utilising Ubuntu 22.04's most recent software features, security updates,      and hardware compatibility changes to provide the best possible computing environment for the team's activities.

### 2.2 Install Operating System in Compute Node
---
The process of installing the operating system on a compute node is similar to that of the head node, with the exception that it is not required the installation of Ubuntu Server specifically.

### 2.3. Power Management
---

   Following a thorough examination of individual components, research has been conducted to determine the optimal power distribution among them. Initially, the plan was to utilize two 750W Power Supply Units (PSUs). However, due to technical malfunctions in one of the PSUs, the decision has been made to employ smaller PSUs for each motherboard separately. The power consumption of each hardware component is provided below for reference.
  
   |      Components        |     Power Consumption (approx)       |       Description        |
   |------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
   |Asus CS-B Intel Core i3 4th Gen | 25W - 40W       | CPU Power Management can be handeled directly from BIOS. It provides subitems that allows to manipulate the CPU ratio and feature.|
   |SAMSUNG V-NAND 500GB SSD| 3W (Active), 50mW (idle)|Each Motherboard will be connected to one of this SSD which can be powered by a same PSU.|  
   |NVIDIA QUADRO           |    45W (Max.)           |Only one of the GPU will be used in the entire system which will be connected to the head node. |        

   |Power Supply Unit (PSU)| Capacity | Description|
   |---|---|---|
   |FSP220-50LC|220W (total output) | This PSU has a maximum wattage of 60W. And the sum of the power requirements for all the components connected to the PSU should not exceed 220W. |

* The single PSU in our system will be connected to one motherboard, one SSD, and one graphics card. The combined power consumption of these components is estimated to be around 95W during active use and less than 90W when in idle state. Although a single 220W PSU could theoretically handle the load for two motherboards, practical constraints like cable and port limitations restrict each PSU to power only one motherboard in our setup

### 6.1. How to Create Machine Learning for Predict Crypto Currencies

To predict cryptocurrency prices with machine learning, start by fetching historical data (prices, volumes, timestamps) using APIs like Alpha Vantage. Process this data, compute technical indicators (RSI, EMA, SMA), and normalize to ensure uniformity. Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets for model development and evaluation. Consider machine learning models such as Random Forest for its robustness, Gradient Boosting for error minimization, LSTM for capturing long-term dependencies, and GRU for efficient sequential data handling. Fine-tune models using the validation set and assess their performance with metrics like RMSE and MAE on the test set, aiming to select the model that best captures cryptocurrency market dynamics.

## 7. Performance Evaluation:
***Develop a strategy for evaluating HPC system performance.***


## 8. Software and OS Maintenance: 
***Implement a system for updating software and the operating system using cron and Git. â€¢ Reflect on the importance of software and OS maintenance in an HPC environment.***


# Design reflection and future improvements 
During the course of this assignment there have been a few development problems and issues that arose in regard to the specific design of the case such as the time impairment, material acquisition, ventilation and change in requirements. In this report I will discuss how each of these problems were analyzed and resolved to display a design that fit the requirements of the projects while also remaining affordable and simple to construct.

# Time impairment 
The first and possible largest issue we faced in constructing the case was time. As we had a fixed amount of time to build and submit the Hpc the case had to be completed in about a month and a half. My first idea was 3D printing the part required to build the frame/shelfing unit. After sending my designs of to be printed I was told that all part would take over 80 das as there was over 65 pieces to print along with other student needing to use the printing facilities as well.to work around this problem I decided that purchasing a frame could be cheaper and less time consuming as well as having more stability. This way I could focus more on altering the internal of the case as well as making a front and rear for the frame. This cut the time to create a case by at least a month allowing more time for alterations if need be
