## Introduction
---todo

## Step 1: Define Requirements

1. Purpose of the HPC System
2. Performance Requirements
   Determine the performance specifications required for the applications, including processing power, memory, storage, and interconnectivity.

## Step 2: Hardware Components

1. Motherboards
2. Single board computers
3. Processor (CPU)
   Select CPUs based on performance requirements. Consider multi-core processors for parallel processing.
4. Memory (RAM)
   Choose sufficient RAM for each node to handle the workload efficiently.
5. Storage:
   Decide on the storage configuration, considering the need for fast access times. SSDs are commonly used for HPC systems.
6. Network Interconnect:
   Choose a high-speed network interconnect, such as InfiniBand or 10/25/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet, depending on your needs.
   ### Cluster Netwrok
       Cluster Network is two or more computing device working together for a common computing purpose. This Network follows the principle of the parallel processing. Parallel processing is the method of using two or more processors(CPUs) to handle seperate chuncks of a same complex tasks. In today's time, most computer have multi-cores (i.e., anywhere from two to tewelve cores) which follows the concept of parallel processing. These multi-cores set-ups are similar to having seperate processors installed in a same computer, which can executes more tasks than a single-core processors. In HPC, this concept is extended to multiple nodes, each equipped with its own set of processors where large computational tasks is broken down into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed simultaneously by multile processor at a same time. 

      High-Speed interconnect are crucial for High-Performance Computer, as we want high data analysis and transfer rate between two nodes to move large amount of data quickly. Along with data transfer, low latency is equally imporatant in HPC, to minimize the time it takes for data to travel between different components of the system. If designing, stock prediction system, developing accurate models often requires extensive training and optimization processes. High-speed interconnects facilitate the rapid exchange of information during these iterative processes, allowing the model to be trained and refined more quickly.
