## Abstract
The provided documentation outlines the comprehensive process undertaken by Team 0 for the design of a High Performance Computing (HPC) system as part of the Advanced Computer Engineering Module for the Computer Engineering Program at the University of Greenwich for the academic year 2023/24. This report guides the reader through a detailed step-by-step procedure encompassing both hardware and software aspects of the project. By following this documentation, readers will gain insights into the systematic approach employed by the team, enabling them to replicate and create their own HPC systems.  

## 1. System Design And Architecture

[Specification of all the components can be found here!](hardware.md)

***Design the architecture, integrating 14 ASUS CS-8 motherboards and single-board computers. Provide critical reflections on the chosen design.***

## 2. Technology Research: 
***Conduct comprehensive research on HPC technologies, power management, non-volatile storage, and RAM. Justify technology choices based on problem domain appropriateness.*** 


### 2.1 Network Interconnect:
   
***Cluster Network is two or more computing device working together for a common computing purpose. This Network follows the principle of the parallel processing. Parallel processing is the method of using two or more processors(CPUs) to handle seperate chuncks of a same complex tasks.***

High-Speed interconnect are crucial for High-Performance Computer(HPC), as we want high data analysis and transfer rate between two nodes to move large amount of data quickly. Along with data transfer, low latency is equally imporatant in HPC, to minimize the time it takes for data to travel between different components of the system. If designing  stock prediction system, developing accurate models often requires extensive training and optimization processes. High-speed interconnects facilitate the rapid exchange of information during these iterative processes, allowing the model to be trained and refined more quickly. 

There are several interconnect technologies available with their own strength and specefic use-cases. Some of them are :

1. **Infiniband** : Computer Networking communication standard used in high-performance computing that features high throughput and very low latency. It supports Remote Direct Memory Access(RDMA), which means the ability to access host memory directly without CPU intervention. Infiniband is widely used in supercomputer clusters and it is preferred network interconnection technology for GPU servers.
2. **NVIDIA NVLink** : World's first high-speed GPU interconnect technology that can connect two graphics card , with low latency, and high bandwidth. It is ideal for the system that uses NVIDIA graphics card, such as those in deep-learning and GPU accelerated computing. It is not best option for our project,as it is only compatible with NVIDIA graphics card and we will be using intel graphics card for our HPC.
3. **Intel Omni-Path Architecture(OPA)** : OPA is communication architecture developed by intel which aims for low communication latency, low power consumption and a high throughput. It is often used for HPC application with Intel processor. OPA directly competes with infiniband.
4. **Ethernet** : Ethernet is one of the commonly used interconnect technology because of its versatility, scalability and compatibility.It migh not provide same low-latency level as specialised interconnect like infiniband but it provides various speed, ranging from 10 megabyte to 100 gigabyte per second.    

The type of interconnect technology one needs lies on what kind of system they are building and what kind of interconnect is compatible with the system. For our system, specefication and hardware is given above.

For this project, Ethernet cables will be utilized due to their accessibility and sufficient speed for project requirements. These cables will serve dual purposes: data transfer and network bridging. The motherboard provided includes two Ethernet ports, both of which will be utilized for interconnecting nodes.

The head node will establish connections with all other nodes via a switch. Two switches will be employed: one for interconnecting all nodes to facilitate data transfer, and the other to distribute internet connectivity from the head node to all compute nodes. 

By default, one of the ports is enabled. However, to activate the second port, users must adhere to the following steps:

            Reboot the motherboard 

            Press the 'F2' or 'Del' button to access the BIOS settings 

            Navigate to Advanced settings using arrow keys.

            Proceed to Network Interface Stack Setting

            Enable the Second Interface named "Retalke Interface" (most of the cases, name may vary)

            Esure that your "Intel Interface" is also enabled.

Once the steps are followed and both interfaces are activated, users can proceed to configure each interface to perform specific tasks. Detailed instructions can be found in the following link: [Configuring Interface using Nm-Connection-Editor](https://github.com/TeachingMaterial/ace-2023_-team-0/tree/documentation/nm-connection-editor-Harishanan)

Ethernet cables were manually crimped for this project, adhering to the Registered Jack 45 (RJ-45) standard. The figure below illustrates the color standard for RJ-45 cables..

Figure: OS Compatibility of Asus CS-B 

1. Once the operating system was determined, below steps are followed to install ubuntu desktop 13.10:
      - Downloaded the Ubuntu Desktop from the official Ubuntu website (https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/13.10/). As Intel processor is used, PC (Intel x86) desktop image is chosen when downloading the image.
      - Created a bootable USB drive using Rufus.
      - Booted the motherboard from the USB drive.
      - Followed the installation wizard to install Ubuntu Desktop on the system.


                  sudo apt update                                           
            
                  sudo apt upgrade

3. Given its role as the head node in our setup, the desktop image is transformed into a server. Let's quickly delve into the significance of the head node within the realm of High-Performance Computing (HPC).

- The head node serves as a central control unit in an HPC environment, orchestrating and managing the entire cluster. Its primary purposes include task scheduling, resource allocation, and overall coordination of computational tasks within the cluster. By installing      the Ubuntu Server and setting the default target to multi-user mode optimize resource allocation, conserving RAM and CPU resources by eschewing unnecessary graphical sessions. This ensures that the head node operates efficiently, enabling it to efficiently manage and    oversee the computational workload of the entire HPC cluster.
  
            To install Ubuntu Server  : sudo apt install ubuntu-server
            To disable GUI            : sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
     
Although the documentation states that the ASUS CS-B motherboard can only run Ubuntu 13.10, a brief test was run to see how the motherboard would react to installing Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish), a more recent version of the operating system. The Ubuntu 22.04       
operating system ran on the system very well, with no noticeable glitches. This surprising finding prompted more investigation into the motherboard's compatibility with the latest Ubuntu versions. 
Although documentation indicates otherwise, one plausible explanation for Ubuntu 22.04's successful running on the ASUS CS-B motherboard could be the hardware compatibility enhancements included in later Ubuntu editions. The Ubuntu operating system is continuously       improved and optimised by its developers throughout time to improve compatibility with a wider variety of hardware setups. Because of this, more recent versions of Ubuntu might by nature support a greater range of motherboards, including the ASUS CS-B. Moreover,         improvements in system libraries, kernel updates, and device drivers in Ubuntu 22.04 can also be responsible for its smooth operation on the ASUS CS-B motherboard. These updates might take care of any compatibility problems that earlier motherboard models might have     had, making it possible to use current Ubuntu editions more smoothly.
After noticing that Ubuntu 22.04 operated steadily on the ASUS CS-B motherboard, the group chose to switch from Ubuntu 13.10 to this more recent version. This choice was driven by the goal of utilising Ubuntu 22.04's most recent software features, security updates,      and hardware compatibility changes to provide the best possible computing environment for the team's activities.

### 5.2 Install Operating System in Compute Node

The process of installing the operating system on a compute node is similar to that of the head node, with the exception that it is not required the installation of Ubuntu Server specifically.


   |Power Supply Unit (PSU)| Capacity | Description|
   |---|---|---|
   |FSP220-50LC|220W (total output) | This PSU has a maximum wattage of 60W. And the sum of the power requirements for all the components connected to the PSU should not exceed 220W. |

* Active Power Consumption:

        CPU: 25W - 40W
        SSD: 3W
        GPU: 45W
        Total Active Power Consumption = CPU + SSD + GPU
        = (25W - 40W) + 3W + 45W
        = 73W - 88W

* Idle Power Consumption (Assuming SSD and GPU are in idle state):


* Power Supply Unit (PSU) Capacity:

        Total Output Capacity: 220W
        Maximum Wattage: 60W

* Conclusion:

    The single PSU in our system will be connected to one motherboard, one SSD, and one graphics card. The total power consumption of the system should not exceed the PSU capacity.
    
    The system is expected to consume between 73W - 88W during active use and between 25.05W - 40.05W when idle. Although a single 220W PSU could theoretically handle the load for two motherboards, practical constraints like cable and port limitations restrict each PSU to power only one motherboard in our setup


## 9. Task Implementation:
### 9.1. How to Create Machine Learning for Predict Crypto Currencies

To predict cryptocurrency prices with machine learning, start by fetching historical data (prices, volumes, timestamps) using APIs like Alpha Vantage. Process this data, compute technical indicators (RSI, EMA, SMA), and normalize to ensure uniformity. Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets for model development and evaluation. Consider machine learning models such as Random Forest for its robustness, Gradient Boosting for error minimization, LSTM for capturing long-term dependencies, and GRU for efficient sequential data handling. Fine-tune models using the validation set and assess their performance with metrics like RMSE and MAE on the test set, aiming to select the model that best captures cryptocurrency market dynamics.
