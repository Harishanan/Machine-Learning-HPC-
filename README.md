## Introduction


**Step 1: Define Requirements**

1. Purpose of the HPC System
2. Performance Requirements

Determine the performance specifications required for the applications, including processing power, memory, storage, and interconnectivity.

**Step 2: Hardware Components**

1. Motherboards
2. Single board computers
3. Processor (CPU)

Select CPUs based on performance requirements. Consider multi-core processors for parallel processing.

1. Memory (RAM)

Choose sufficient RAM for each node to handle the workload efficiently.

1. Storage:

Decide on the storage configuration, considering the need for fast access times. SSDs are commonly used for HPC systems.

1. Network Interconnect:

Choose a high-speed network interconnect, such as InfiniBand or 10/25/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet, depending on your needs.
