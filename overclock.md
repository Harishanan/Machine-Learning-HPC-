# Overclocking CPU via BIOS

Below are the steps that can be followed to overclock the CPU:

            Over Clock Using BIOS Configuration 

            Reboot your machine 

            Go to BIOS/UEFI using 'Del' or 'F2' Button  

After going inside BIOS, Navigate to Overclocking option, usually it is present in `Overclocking Settings` under `Advance` Settings.

            Navigate to Advanced

            Head to Overclocking CPU and Enable it

            Adjust CPU frequency 

When following these steps, it's important to note that the CPU frequency directly impacts the CPU's speed. Adjusting this parameter should be done cautiously, taking into account guidelines provided by the motherboard manufacturer. After modifying the frequency, it's essential to also adjust the voltage settings to ensure system stability. This involves carefully considering both the CPU speed and voltage, adhering to motherboard specifications throughout the process.

            Navigate to CPU Voltage

            Adjust them as required.

Once these steps are completed, press the "Esc" or "F10" key to exit the BIOS/UEFI setup utility. Save the changes made during the overclocking process before exiting. By following these steps, users can adjust the CPU frequency to suit their requirements.
