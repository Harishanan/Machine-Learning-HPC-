## Cluster Package Management Script

### Script Breakdown

1. Display Usage Information
bash
Copy code
usage() {
    echo "Usage: $0 -i|-u <package_name>"
    exit 1
}
This function provides the user with information on how to use the script correctly. It is called when the script is run without arguments or with invalid options.

2. Parse Command-Line Options
bash
Copy code
while getopts ":iu" opt; do
    case ${opt} in
        i ) ACTION="install";;
        u ) ACTION="remove";;
        \? ) usage;;
    esac
done
shift $((OPTIND -1))
This snippet processes the command-line options passed to the script, determining whether the user wishes to install or uninstall a package. It calls the usage function if an invalid option is provided.

3. Check for Package Name Argument
bash
Copy code
PACKAGE_NAME=$1
if [ -z "$PACKAGE_NAME" ]; then
    usage
fi
After option parsing, the script checks if the package name has been specified. If not, it displays the usage information.

4. Perform Action on the Host
bash
Copy code
perform_action_local() {
    # Checks and actions for installing or removing the package on the host
}

perform_action_local
Defines and calls a function to install or uninstall the package on the host system, based on the previously set ACTION variable.

5. Scan for Active Hosts
bash
Copy code
MAP_OUTPUT=$(nmap -sn 192.168.0.1/24 -oG - | awk '/Up$/{print $2" "$3}')
Utilizes nmap to scan for active hosts within the subnet 192.168.0.1/24. The output is processed to extract IP addresses and hostnames.

6. Identify Client Hosts and Users
bash
Copy code
# Loop through the nmap output to populate CLIENT_HOSTS and CLIENT_USERS arrays
This part parses the output from the previous step, filtering out the head node and preparing a list of client hosts and corresponding user names for SSH access.

7. Perform Action on Client Nodes
bash
Copy code
perform_action_client() {
    # SSH into each client and install/remove the package
}

# Loop through each client and call perform_action_client in parallel
Defines a function to perform the specified action (install/uninstall) on each client node via SSH, then iterates over the list of client hosts and users to apply these actions concurrently.

8. Finalize Operations
bash
Copy code
wait
echo "All client operations completed."
Waits for all background operations (SSH commands) to complete, then prints a message indicating that the script has finished executing.
